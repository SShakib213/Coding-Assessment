# Coding-Assessment

Firstly, to solve the Flask API with Authentication problem, I implemented user registration, login, and protected routes using JWT-based authentication. I ensured secure token handling and clean endpoint logic. In this problem, /register accepts a username and a password. User data is stored in a Python dictionary for simplicity. /login authenticates the user and issues a JWT token using the flask-jwt-extended library. /protected is a route that only a user with a valid token can access. The authentication logic is token-based and stateless. Also, each endpoint was thoroughly tested using Postman, where users could successfully register an account, log in with valid credentials to receive a JWT token, and use that token to access protected routes. The logic is clean and modular, so that it can be extended later to use a real database like PostgreSQL or SQLite. For the second task, I solved it using Django Rest Framework and JWT authentication. /api/register is a custom API view that creates a new user. /api/token uses the built-in token view to generate access and refresh tokens. In /api/posts, authenticated users can create and list posts. Also, a custom permission class has been implemented that ensures only the user who created a post can modify or delete. All endpoints, as well as token-based authorization and verified access control, were similarly tested using Postman. In conclusion, while testing using Postman, I also checked how API gives responses to incorrect credentials or unauthorized access. I believe that this is the right solution because it is scalable for real-world use and also follows best practices.
